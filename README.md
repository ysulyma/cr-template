This is a basic project template for ractive-player.

## Installation

Clone this repository, then do

```bash
npm install
```

## Recording

Compile in **development** mode:

```bash
webpack --watch
```

Now open the page and click on the recording (circle) icon in the controls.

Select Markers for recording (to record Audio, you must access the page over HTTPS). Use the keyboard command to start/stop recording. Then:

1. Save the audio file (if any) to `audio/audio.webm`.

2. Copy the markers to `src/markers.ts`.

3. Copy the code recording to `src/recordings.ts`.

## Replaying

To view the code recording, change `src/production/media-url.ts` to export `"."`. (Once you are satisfied with your recording, you should upload your audio files to a static assets host and put that as the media URL instead.) Then compile in **production** mode:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production webpack
```

## Mastering

See the [Mastering guide](https://ractive-player.org/docs/guide/mastering#audio) for how to fix the browser recording (which doesn't come with the metadata needed for seeking) and convert it to mp4.

To generate thumbnail previews for the ractive, use [`rp-master thumbs`](https://ractive-player.org/docs/rp-master/thumbs). These should again be uploaded to your static assets host.

To produce a static rendering of the ractive, use [`rp-master render`](https://ractive-player.org/docs/rp-master/render/).

## Tips

Beware that `@env` is a magic directory that refers to either `src/development` or `src/production` depending on `NODE_ENV`. This is specified in `webpack.config.js`.
